This project is a data analysis on Airbnb data from the year 2016. The project was started as a requirement for project 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Files contained in repository
calendar.csv - Listing availability data for all Seattle Airbnb listings for 2016. The file also contains the listing price of each listing.  
listings.csv - More details about each listing. Information about listing amenities, listing type, number of bathrooms and bedrooms are included in this file.  
UdacityProject1_AirBnB_Seattle_Final.ipynb - Jupyter notebook file containing the data analysis. This notebook outlines the data analysis process from start to end with descriptions of all steps taken.   

## Summary of results
The following findings were made during the analysis:
1. The busiest time for Airbnb listings is between April and August for Seattle.  
2. Other neighbourhoods, Downtown and Capitol Hill have generated the most revenue during 2016.  
3. Magnolia, Downtown and Queen Anne have the highest average listing price for 2016.
4. Cascade, Queen Anne and Capital Hill have the highest occupancy rate for 2016.  
5. Being a superhost has no affect on the occupancy rate of the listings.  
6. Amenities such as an airbed, a couch, a real-bed, a pull out sofa and a futon were revealed as predictors for the listing price of homes on airbnb in Seattle for 2016.  
7. Northgate, Rainier Valley, Interbay, Delridge, Beacon Hill and Seward park were revealed as the predictors for the listing price of homes on airbnb in Seattle for 2016.
